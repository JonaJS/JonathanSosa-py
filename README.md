<h2>Hi there, I'm Jonathan Jimenez! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lOgu1OnjYF2GHBfRU4/giphy.gif" width=50></h2>
<p>I am a computer systems engineer from üá≤üáΩ and I am currently learning Pythonüêç. One of my passions is learning about technology in order to help people with their problems. Here in this account you will be able to find topics related with Python like methods, functions and some kind of tricks that I hope they can help to you.</p>
<p>
What can you wait to see this 2021? Well, since I've been studying for some couple of months I think it's time to start with projects to put in practice everything (or almost everything) I've learned.
